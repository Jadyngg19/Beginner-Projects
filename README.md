# Beginner-Projects

## Description
This  Repository is used to keep my beginner level projects from my Bootcamp course linked to my Portfolio Webpage. As I complete my assignments, I add them here in order to keep them all in one place to be accessed. This will allow people to see each different assignment if they try to access it from my Portfolio Webpage and want to see the work that I have done.
